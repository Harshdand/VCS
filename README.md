Vehicle Cognition System

Vehicle Cognition System is an intelligent software system that fits into the Pervasive Computing genre. Vehicle Cognition System uses the features available in modern smart-phone to develop a non-tangible vehicle-to-vehicle protocol that acts as a warning system and warns the car about any approaching car by building a virtual map of car trajectories , that the cars in the vicinity is likely to follow based on crucial information obtained through the protocol. The system also proposes a path finding algorithm, executed by the vehicle guidance system activated by the protocolâ€™s collision detection system, by taking our car controls, through cruise control. Once the guidance system guides the car to safety the protocol relinquishes the control of the car to the driver.
